# Performance Metrics Checklist

This document provides a checklist for measuring performance improvements after implementing the Web Worker solution for heavy computations.

## Key Metrics to Measure

### 1. Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- **Before Implementation**: High TBT due to heavy computation on the main thread
- **After Implementation**: Should be significantly reduced as the computation now runs in a Web Worker
- **How to Measure**: 
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
  - Run a performance recording while the page loads
  - Look for the "Total Blocking Time" metric in the summary

### 2. First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Before Implementation**: May be delayed due to main thread blocking
- **After Implementation**: Should be faster as the main thread is free to render content
- **How to Measure**: 
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab or Lighthouse
  - Look for the "First Contentful Paint" metric

### 3. Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Before Implementation**: Delayed due to main thread being blocked
- **After Implementation**: Should be much faster as the UI remains responsive
- **How to Measure**: 
  - Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
  - Look for the "Time to Interactive" metric

### 4. UI Responsiveness
- **Before Implementation**: UI jank and unresponsiveness during computation
- **After Implementation**: UI should remain responsive even during heavy computation
- **How to Test**: 
  - Try clicking buttons or scrolling while the computation is running
  - The UI should respond immediately

### 5. CPU Usage
- **Before Implementation**: High CPU usage on the main thread
- **After Implementation**: CPU usage distributed between main thread and worker thread
- **How to Measure**: 
  - Use Chrome DevTools Performance Monitor
  - Look at CPU usage during page load and computation

## How to Run Performance Tests

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Click the record button and reload the page
4. Stop recording after the page has fully loaded and the computation has completed
5. Analyze the results focusing on the metrics above
6. Compare with previous measurements to verify improvements

## Expected Improvements

- Total Blocking Time should decrease by 80-100%
- First Contentful Paint should improve
- Time to Interactive should improve significantly
- UI should remain responsive during computation
- Main thread CPU usage should be lower

These measurements will help verify that moving the heavy computation to a Web Worker has successfully improved the application's performance.
